# Horiseon Readme Notes

### Introduction:
Hello and welcome to my first coding project! The objective of this task was to refactor a website that was supplied to comply with accessability standards. This task included changing all tags (where applicable) to semantic HTML elements, updating CSS, reorganizing, and adding comments to ensure legibility.

### Here is the final product:
